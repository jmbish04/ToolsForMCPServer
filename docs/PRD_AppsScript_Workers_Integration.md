## Integration OFF AppsScript & Cloudflare Workers

This PRD outlines a project architecture that leverages the strengths of both Google AppsScript (GAS) and Cloudflare Workers to build applications that are based on Google Workspace tools, but with modern web app frameworks and edge computing for scalability and responsiveness.

## GOALS
1. Integrate Google AppsScript with Cloudflare Workers
2. Trust Google OAuth for authentication
3. Provide automatable, scalable blackend apps
x. Expose data via MLP, JWOR, or a custom api from Workers
x. Defer cross-domain runtimes and request handling to the edge

## Key Architectures
- GasServiceHandler as the primary OAuth and data engine
- WorkerServer for performance-oriented web apps with authorization channels
- Cloudframe Workers redirecting as the backend computation service
- MCP interface provided through GOAPs, communicates via standardized JSON

## Recommendations
- Git started with the tools/scripts from the Base Repo with creation of a clean data/code layer
- Use worker catechers for routing requests to GAS services from Within workers or a frented adapter extension
- Security auth, using the authuser or Spreadchecked OAuth with Google Services Account
- Allow user-level configuration and token handling through GAS, without exposing to broad network

## Next Steps
- Configure JSON schemas for access to backend vs web-routed data
- Set up authenticated endpoints for edach flow
- Integrate all tools through MiniDurables and ProjectPlanner using the PMO ApI
